                <h2>How It Works</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How many mechanics will contact me?</h3>
                    <p>Typically 2-3 verified mechanics will respond to your request. You'll receive their contact information and can reach out to get quotes and ask questions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I choose which mechanic I use?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely! You're free to contact all the matched mechanics, compare quotes and availability, and choose whoever you prefer. You're never obligated to use any specific shop.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if I don't like any of the matches?</h3>
                    <p>You're under no obligation to use any of the matched mechanics. If none work for you, simply don't book with them.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do the mechanics know they're competing for my business?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. Mechanics understand that you may be comparing multiple quotes, which encourages fair pricing and good service.</p>
